This is a modified version of the original DFSCoerce-exe.(https://github.com/jfma7/DFSCoerce-exe)
I added the ability to specify alternate credentials for explicit authentication. 
This can be particularly useful when running from a non-domain-joined machine with local user or when there is a need to execute it as a different user.
